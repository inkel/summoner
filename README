Summoner
========

Summoner is a really simple fixture replacemoent for Ruby.

How to install
--------------
gem install summoner


You can _prepare_ your _monsters_ like:

Summoner.prepare :monster do |c|
  c.type "Esper"
end

Then, you can _summon_ your _monsters_ like:

Summoner.summon :monster

Or, if you need to override default values:

Summoner.summon :monster do |c|
  c.type "Guardian"
end

Also, you can override options with a hash:

Summoner.summon(:monster, :type => "Avatar")

v0.1.2
======
From v0.1.2 on, you can also summon ActiveRecord instances directly from their classes without prepare them before, for example:

Monster.summon do |m|
  m.type = "Esper"
end

Note the difference between with the _prepare_ method, here you should use the *=* sign to assign values.


Rails
-----

1. Add config.gem "summoner" to the config/environments/test.rb or gem "summoner" to your Gemfile if you're using bundler
2. Define your _monsters_ on a file, e.g: spec/monsters.rb (you can call it as you please)
3. Require that file on your (test|spec)_helper.rb
4. Summon your _monsters_ on your tests/specs
