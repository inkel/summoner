Wizard
======

Wizard is a really simple fixture replacement for Ruby.

You can _prepare_ your _spells_ like:

Wizard.prepare :conjure do |c|
  c.name "Turn to Toad"
end

Then, you can _invoke_ your _spells_ like:

Wizard.invoke :conjure

Or, if you need to override default values:

Wizard.invoke :conjure do |c|
  c.name "Turn back to man"
end
